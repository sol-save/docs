We didn't want you to switch between the `git` and `gitsol` commands, so we made it so that all unrecognised gitsol commands will be run with the `git` command instead.

Try something like

```bash
gitsol checkout -b dev
```

or

```bash
npx gitsol checkout -b dev
```

`checkout` was an unrecognised command, so it was run with the `git` command.
