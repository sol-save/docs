## Known Issues

We built the whole CLI in a single day so it's definite that there's a lot of stuff that could be improved.


Here's a few things we know are not working:
- We do not auto-fund the devnet accounts.
- It currently doesn't work with yarn installs.
- We haven't built custom wrappers for each git command. Just the `add` and `commit` commands. Rest all git commands are ran through a default function.
- We want to build our own API and internal auth to provide uploads. We do not want users to go through the painful flow of optaining an API key.
- Currently pulling changes removes all local changes.
- Git conflicts are not handled, instead if you push a conflicting file, it completely overwrites the remote file. This is dangerous and we'll fix it soon.
